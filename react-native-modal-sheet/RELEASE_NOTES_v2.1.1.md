# Release Notes - v2.1.1

## 🎯 Release Summary

Version 2.1.1 brings a major internal refactoring that significantly improves code maintainability and developer experience without any breaking changes. The entire codebase has been reorganized into a clean, modular architecture.

## 📦 What's Changed

### Major Internal Refactoring
- **Modular Architecture**: Complete reorganization from a monolithic 1166-line component to a clean modular structure
- **Custom Hooks**: Extracted complex logic into reusable hooks:
  - `useKeyboardHandler` - Keyboard avoidance logic
  - `useAnimations` - Animation management
  - `useGestureHandlers` - Touch/mouse gesture handling
  - `useScrollHandler` - Scroll-to-expand behavior
  - `useSnapPoints` - Snap points calculations
- **Organized Structure**: Clear separation with dedicated directories for components, hooks, types, styles, and utils
- **Improved Maintainability**: Each feature now lives in its own module with single responsibility

## ✅ No Breaking Changes

- API remains 100% compatible with v2.1.0
- All props and methods work exactly as before
- Drop-in replacement - no code changes required
